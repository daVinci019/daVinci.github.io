        <h2><u>First post</u></h2>
        <h6>March 9 2022</h6>
        <p>Today I'm making this Blog, it excites me to learn stuff and some part of my self want's to be a web developer. So, I decided to continue my studies and <strong>practice even more! :)</strong></p>
        
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        
        <h2>Programming Journey</h2>
        <p>I am proud of what I've learned so far. I know I will have many<br>challenges that encounter and somepoint It might get <br>hard enough for me but I know I can do it, and I will do it. Programming is a big challenge for me since I'm a begineer but I think <strong><em>I can and I will push it to the end</em></strong>.</p>

        <h2>Food I Love</h2>

        <p align="center"><strong>Sometimes whenever I feel sad or stressed I ate food with a mix of some music. Trust me It's a good combination you'll never regret it! :D</strong></p><br>

        <br>
        
        <h2>I Love Dogs</h2>
        <p>Dogs are social pack animals who thrive off of attention and <br> affection, making them a prime candidate for a person's best friend. <br>Since dogs have been domesticated to a point where they need us to survive, and we tend to find that we need them almost as much. Me and my dogs developed a symbiotic relationship.</p>

        <h2>Tips and Thanks</h2>
        <p align="center">Hello Friends! I would like to express my gratitude to those people who help me and support me. I want also to say that even though you had troubles in making or understanding a program,<strong> DON'T GIVE UP</strong> because in difficult things there are a broader knowledge and discoveries. Take your precious time, cause although there is Sunset's there's a brighter Sunrise that looking forward to you. Fighting my dear friends! </p><hr>
